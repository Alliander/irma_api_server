Two things should be present here:
- the irma_configuration folder or a symlink to it
- an RSA secret key in DER format, called 'sk.der'

Optionally:
- a configuration file called 'config.json', see the included sample file;
- RSA public keys (in .der format) for incoming requests from identity providers.
